    <p>
        These squash tots are an addicting tasty snack that I love to make using yellow squash straight from our garden.

    <h5>Ingredients</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>3 small yellow squashes or zucchini - about 1-1.5 lb yellow squash </li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>4 oz grated cheddar cheese or other meltable cheese (about 1/2 cup grated) </li>
        <li>3/4 cup breadcrumbs </li>
        <li>1/2 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt </li>
        <li>Ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>Optional: 2 tablespoons - 1/4 cup finely minced parsley leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Steps</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper (or grease the baking sheet with olive oil).</li>
        <li>Grate the squash on a fine grater (or use a food processor). Add 1/2 teaspoon salt, and mix it together. Put the grated squash in a colander (or use a cheesecloth, see notes). Let sit while you prepare the rest of the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Use your hands to squeeze all the extra liquid from the grated squash in the colander. You should have about 1 cup of liquid for every pound of squash you use. Discard the liquid.</li>
        <li>Combine all the tot ingredients in a large bowl and mix well. The mixture should be sticky and wet, like a thick paste. If it is too wet, add extra breadcrumbs. Form small tots with your hands (about 1.5-2 tablespoons squash mixture per tot). Tip: dip your hands into a bowl of cold water in between every few tots - this will help keep the squash mixture from sticking to your hands!</li>
        <li>Arrange the tots on the parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake at 400F for 25 minutes, or until golden on top and lightly browned on the bottom. Allow to rest 5 minutes before removing them from the baking sheet - this will help prevent them from sticking. </li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
